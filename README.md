## SmartML Assistant

Your AI-powered assistant for data analysis, model building, and insights — without writing a single line of code.

📌 Overview
SmartML Assistant is a web application that empowers data analysts and data scientists users to work with machine learning through a simple, user-friendly interface. It removes the barrier of coding by guiding users step-by-step through the entire AI workflow:

📊 Data Analysis – Upload datasets, explore patterns, and preprocess data with ease.
🤖 Model Building – Train machine learning models automatically using configurable options.
🔍 AI Insights – Interact with trained models to make predictions and derive actionable insights.
⚡ No-Code Experience – Perform end-to-end AI tasks without manual programming.

### 🚀 Features
1. Dataset Management: Upload and manage CSV datasets.
2. Preprocessing Tools: Clean, transform, and prepare data automatically.
3. Model Training: Choose algorithms, configure parameters, and train ML models.
4. Evaluation Metrics: View performance results including accuracy, precision, recall, and more.
5. Model Interaction: Run predictions directly from the web interface.
6. User-Friendly Interface: Designed for both technical and non-technical users.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
